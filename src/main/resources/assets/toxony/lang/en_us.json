I will not stop, even if you leave me with NOTHING!\n\nThey took everything but this journal. Left with only my thoughts written down.",
  "journal.toxony.page.introduction.1": "Everything I have researched about poisons and ailments. No one saw its potential, no one understood the work I sweat and bled for! So I will show them all. All of them! We can make these dangerous phenomena benefit us! The world will see it! I will not leave my research EMPTY.",
  "journal.toxony.page.index.0": "I will find their secrets, their brilliance, their value, my value, even if I am to be abandoned.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.0": "Before things begin, some tools are necessary. As I was kicked from the academy my accessories have been removed from me. Study cannot be made without my physical aids. As such I have to make due with some primitive and crude methods. A mortar and pestle although simple, proves to me a valuable tool and a cheap system to process basic ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.1": "Basics for a mortar and pestle can be made in a crafting table with the following pattern. Its use will be significant for the first product of in my research.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.2": "In my initial studies I sought a way to process the volatile substance, poison in order to control its behaviors. I realized I needed something foundational, malleable. In my hours of toiling and understanding of alchemical reactions, I made a base for future recipes that allowed me to use poison as a mixture of various plants and ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.3": "Although rather weak, it was to be used for my experimental research. An ingredient that can be refined later but tested now. A proof of concept. The recipe is easy to produce as it will eventually be used consistently in my future recipes.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.4": "All it requires is at least one naturally poisonous plant and one poison ingredient not of herbaceous origin. Then finally some bone meal to put it all together.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.5": "Unfortunately, as I no longer have the academy resources, a lot of the materials for poison paste are not easy to obtain. Without an assistant, I will have to manually retrieve them. Although I am not accustom to foraging, it is what I must do. Fortunately I have already done extensive research on poisonous flora. I can already document my knowledge on these specimens.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.0": "Ocelot Mint is a rather dangerous poisonous mint. Discovered after an unfortunate ailment possessed a temple excavation crew. Equally unfortunate was learning the excavation crew were actually my junior students. After obtaining their samples, the jungle became my new obsession for the next few weeks.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.1": "Nightshade is as beautiful as my first love. And just like her, it packs much more under its bushy exterior. Like a mirage, its vibrate petals hide black berries that are dangerous when consumed. Like a gorgeous nymph in the dark forest. Which conveniently is where these deadly day lilies are found.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.2": "Water Hemlock has a cloudy appearance but you would be mistaken to think it had any similarities to real clouds. These deadly plants exists in marshy and frankly smelly swamps. They are easy to spot but don't make the trek any more enjoyable. Now that I ponder on it, the smell probably came from the deceased wildlife surrounding its base.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.3": "Based on its name, you can discern where it naturally grows. Coldsnap exists in the most frigid taigas. Its vibrant blue is an appealing visual gift, if you wish to quickly befall anyone who receives it. Looking through snowy forests will help you locate these poisonous flowers.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.4": "How did I come to obtain this specimen??? Its rather concerning how any plant life exists in the Nether but Bloodroot, as the name hints, exists in Crimson Forests. I came across this through a trader. Now that I think back, I don't think I was trading with a person.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.5": "Many of the flora can be converted into seeds just by crafting them alone. But in order to plant them, the soil must be as potent as they are. Luckily, my poison paste can convert normal farmland into a much more lethal variant. Just use the poison paste on farmland and voila! I can make a garden just as beautiful as it is deadly.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.6": "Many parts of a mob, including ourselves, react differently when toxins are introduced in their bodies. This makes unique ingredients when certain mobs are afflicted. As such, we should extract them. When a mob dies while being afflicted with poison, they can drop special ingredients. However, a sword is too crude to extract them. As such, they must die by a scalpel in order to carefully extract these valuable ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.7": "These vicious fangs seems to have convenient cracks and crevasses for feeding in violent venoms. Wolves can develop such dangerous fangs when covered in poison. We can then extract these new fangs when killing wolves with a scalpel. ",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.8": "A strange reaction is formed with spit when poison is introduced into llamas. Some of their saliva take on this green-ish hue. Its still quite delicate so using a scalpel is recommended. Although its still rather gross to hold.",
