My work, my ideas, ABANDONED!\n\nHow idiotic. brainless. foolish. halfwItTed, moRONiC, EMPTY-HEADED, INSANE. STUPID. I will not stop, even if you leave me with NOTHING!\n\nThey took everything but this journal. Left with only my thoughts written down.",
  "journal.toxony.page.introduction.1": "Everything I have researched about poisons and ailments. No one saw its potential, no one understood the work I sweat and bled for! So I will show them all. All of them! We can make these dangerous phenomena benefit us! The world will see it! I will not leave my research EMPTY.",
  "journal.toxony.page.index.0": "I will find their secrets, their brilliance, their value, my value, even if I am to be abandoned.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.0": "Before things begin, some tools are necessary. As I was kicked from the academy my accessories have been removed from me. Study cannot be made without my physical aids. As such I have to make due with some primitive and crude methods. A mortar and pestle although simple, proves to me a valuable tool and a cheap system to process basic ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.1": "Basics for a mortar and pestle can be made in a crafting table with the following pattern. Its use will be significant for the first product of in my research.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.2": "In my initial studies I sought a way to process the volatile substance, poison in order to control its behaviors. I realized I needed something foundational, malleable. In my hours of toiling and understanding of alchemical reactions, I made a base for future recipes that allowed me to use poison as a mixture of various plants and ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.3": "Although rather weak, it was to be used for my experimental research. An ingredient that can be refined later but tested now. A proof of concept. The recipe is easy to produce as it will eventually be used consistently in my future recipes.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.4": "All it requires is at least one naturally poisonous plant and one poison ingredient not of herbaceous origin. Then finally some bone meal to put it all together.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.5": "Unfortunately, as I no longer have the academy resources, a lot of the materials for poison paste are not easy to obtain. Without an assistant, I will have to manually retrieve them. Although I am not accustom to foraging, it is what I must do. Fortunately I have already done extensive research on poisonous flora. I can already document my knowledge on these specimens.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.0": "Ocelot Mint is a rather dangerous poisonous mint. Discovered after an unfortunate ailment possessed a temple excavation crew. Equally unfortunate was learning the excavation crew were actually my junior students. After obtaining their samples, the jungle became my new obsession for the next few weeks.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.1": "Nightshade is as beautiful as my first love. And just like her, it packs much more under its bushy exterior. Like a mirage, its vibrate petals hide black berries that are dangerous when consumed. Like a gorgeous nymph in the dark forest. Which conveniently is where these deadly day lilies are found.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.2": "Water Hemlock has a cloudy appearance but you would be mistaken to think it had any similarities to real clouds. These deadly plants exists in marshy and frankly smelly swamps. They are easy to spot but don't make the trek any more enjoyable. Now that I ponder on it, the smell probably came from the deceased wildlife surrounding its base.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.3": "Based on its name, you can discern where it naturally grows. Coldsnap exists in the most frigid taigas. Its vibrant blue is an appealing visual gift, if you wish to quickly befall anyone who receives it. Looking through snowy forests will help you locate these poisonous flowers.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.4": "How did I come to obtain this specimen??? Its rather concerning how any plant life exists in the Nether but Bloodroot, as the name hints, exists in Crimson Forests. I came across this through a trader. Now that I think back, I don't think I was trading with a person.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.5": "Although a little maddening, I've heard of an ancient technique of consuming a blend of these deadly flora to boost ones immune system. They speak of power from these poisonous herbs but I'm not sure how. These plants are rather painful to even touch let alone eat out of the blue. However, their techniques peaked my interest. Why would anyone consume these dangerous plants?",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.6": "After reviewing my old studies, I managed to obtain some recipe for making specialty blends for consumption. Maybe I'll try some a little each day. Although not a leaf more. This is a rather dangerous game.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.7": "In the event I am overcome of excessive toxins in my body, I should have a golden apple or regeneration potion ready. They provide a remedy should I go overboard and consume too many volatile poisons. I hope this will not be needed, otherwise the pain already is unbearable.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.0": "I always envied the creation of lotions and balms. The desire of extravagance can be both irritating and intoxicating. These desires are wasted on cosmetics. My desire however, brings excitement. Many traveling sellswords value good oils. Weapons are expensive, yet improvements are cheap. With untamable mobs that roam the dimensions, applying specialty oils can make the fighting easier.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.1": "To create oils, we first need to create a container to hold it. Using clay and some poison paste, I can mold a small pot which can then be fired in a furnace, creating the basic oil pot container for oils.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.2": "The basis of my research can now be used on my weapons. Using poison paste, and honeycomb, mixed in a mortar, then collected into an Oil Pot. When striking someone with this oil applied, poison will consume the victim until they are in an inch of their life.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.3": "After an incident involving a minor encounter with Water Hemlock, I've learned it has rather coma-inducing effect. And after I bashed my head under my table. Naturally I wanted to turn it into an oil. When striking someone with this oil applied, victims will naturally feel slower and weaker.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.4": "Sometimes you need to highlight some important targets. I imagine this oil would be useful for blind companions. Actually this wouldn't help them. And I don't have any other companions either...\nWhen striking someone with this oil applied, they will glow for a long period of time.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.5": "This oil is a bit situational but it was a product of examining the properties of Bloodroot. Who knows when I will need to apply this directly to my companions; which I still do not currently have. When striking someone with this oil applied, they will gain temporary fire resistance.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.6": "Once these oils are created, they can be applied in two ways. Either by holding the oil in one hand and the item I want to oil in the other, then using the oil pot. Or placing the oil pot down by crouching, then using the placed oil with an item in my hand. Either method will use some of the oil. Don't worry about using it up, the pot still stays and eventually I will produce a method to refill them.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.0": "I miss many of my tools used back in the academy. My hands feel idle even if I am churning the ingredients within the mortar all day to pass the time. I am getting antsy for some experimentation. I think it is time to mold all my missing accessories. Using the materials I have mined and my crafting table I think I will be able to re-create all my tools I've lost.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.1": "One of my most important devices was created by myself back at the academy. Made with local smiths and the approval of the ethics council (albeit not honestly). It is a masterful device that monitors your chemical composition. Specifically how much of your chemistry is toxic.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.2": "A scalpel may seem like only a tool of medicine, but it is equally as important within chemistry. Its intricate, convenient, and most importantly precise. The scalpel may help me with procuring very delicate material from mobs that a sword could not extract.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.3": "A magnifying glass for viewing material closer. This may not be useful at the moment but later on it might be beneficial to have when I start looking deeper into the poisonous materials.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.0": "While toiling with oils and poisons, I had an uninvited guest enter my lab. In desperation, I threw my oil directly at the creature. I learned something very useful that day. As a result, I created a sash that allowed me to weaponize oil in another way.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.1": "Because of clever design, I can easily add any oil on the sash simply by holding the sash in one hand and an oil pot in the other. Doing so will fill the sash with the contents of the oil pot. Behold, a chemical bomb! It can be used about 16 times. Not as many as I hoped but it will make due. Also, this has given me another brilliant idea.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.2": "This complex device Is similar to its cousin the crossbow. However, through extensive research and engineering, I have managed to compact it down to a single-handed crossbow that can fire two additional shots before needing to be loaded.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.3": "However, because of its size, its power has been scaled down. To compensate, I have made special ammunition. A catalyst for oil. Using the bolts inside a placed oil pot, it can be covered in oil, applying its effect to hit targets. Do keep in mind some oils will not apply to the bolts.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.0": "After some hours of crushing, lighting, refining, I have found a way to produce a more stable and pure substance against my messy predecessor. I've learned poison paste becomes more pure when introduced to heat. However, the concentration of heat necessary to produce this effect cannot be obtained through a furnace.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.1": "As such I was reminded of another tool used for intense heat treatment for any single material. Although it cannot mass-heat many items as well as a furnace can, it will give us enough heat to refine our poison paste to higher potential!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.2": "The crucible can now be used to heat a single poison paste and turn it into what I call \"Toxic Paste\". The name isn't particularly compelling but it gets the effect across. This is the beginning of true chemistry!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.3": "With toxic paste in my arsenal, I can improve on the techniques of the ancients. I can create a more powerful blend using it. But I must be incredibly careful. My system may not be able to handle it if I haven't already grown accustom.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.4": "I have been locking myself in for several days. Rationing my resources, burning through old books. I've found something magnificent. This paste I have made has a unique effect after toiling with potions. It seems the netherwart in them are binding their structure. But their attraction is faint. I need a way to purify the process. I think I know what will work.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.5": "I will need a small glass container. Bottles are too large to precisely measure and are also quite fragile for my intended uses. So I will need to create a smaller vessel for my formulas. I must create a smaller and stronger container!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.6": "Using glass vials, I can create a container that's reinforced with Copper. This larger much heavier container is a valuable part. A presage to the grand creation of...",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.7": "The Alembic. An old device in the academy that will help purify liquids similar to how the crucible purifies solids. However, they are fragile. In order for this to work, I need a stronger glassy material. I know located in the Nether. I must find it!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.8": "The base is also required for the alembic to function. This is how it is made.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.9": "The alembic can refine weaker potions into their stronger variants without the need of additional material. Purifying the liquid to a more concentrated form. Although the potion is not enough! The alembic has gotten them closer to binding with my paste, but its not pure enough.",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.0": "I think I can devise a solution that uses only the most concentrated form of Netherwart! To unlock what poison has to offer us! I've collected all my notes, stood through consecutive nights. My mind has been awake  past dusk more times than I can count. With the glass vials and my toxic paste...",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.1": "I've almost done it! The material to be used to unlock the full potential of poison. I have formulated this concoction to prepare the final creation of the ultimate substance! But I'll need to enter the nether one more time.",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.2": "How unfortunate. I've seem to have lost one of my two appendages after my excursion into the Nether. But it does not matter. I got what I needed. The table is set, the materials laid out. Everything in its perfect place. I have made sure the process will succeed. All my documents, research, my notes. I am going to make a substance that will change the world.",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.3": "No matter the cost.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.0": "The ancients lacked vision. They stopped at just blends without realizing what these poisons can really do. I've felt the changes. Every night I feel the toxins pulsing in my blood. I'm changing, I feel much stronger, feel more alert. Its revelating.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.1": "Something I noticed but the poisonous blends I consume. The ingredients I use all have affinities relating to them. Each poisonous material is connected to some aspects of this world. Some ingredients have affinity to the ocean, while others have a natural affinity to the moon. I can examine these affinities closely using a magnifying glass I made earlier.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.2": "However, to discover their affinities, I must do one of two things. Either I consume everything poisonous thing I come across until I know where their affinities lie. This is the most painful method. Or something much more efficient. I've learned a way to deconstruct an ingredients chemical makeup into a more pure substance. And watch its effects as a third party spectator.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.3": "Redstone is quite sensitive to the toxic components of poisonous ingredients. As seen used by my tox gauge device. First I must turn it into a mixture.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.4": "Next I must heat it in a crucible to break down any unnecessary parts.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.5": "Then finally, with the alembic, I will purify it with a poisonous ingredient I want to examine to find the affinity it is associated with. This creates a solution I can put into any subject and review its effects.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.6": "I will need a tool to administrator into my unfortunate specimen. Luckily with the help of another doctoral tool, I can make a simple copper needle. One especially capable of handling dangerous solutions.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.7": "This process may be long but it is invaluable to know what these natural affinities are. I need to inject this solution into a strong enough subject, and when its at its lowest point, the affinity associated with that poisonous ingredient will reveal itself to me!",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.8": "By holding the solution in one and, and then the needle in the other, I can put the solution inside the needle. Then once I find a very strong subject, I must bring their life at the brink (poison should do the trick). Once its at an inch of its life, that's when I use the needle.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.9": "Once I have enough data on a specific poisonous ingredient, I can hold my magnifying glass in my hand and hover over it to see what affinity this poisonous ingredient is associated with. Oh the beautiful art of experimental science!",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.0": "We won't stop at simple oils. We have much more possibilities FOR MORE POTENCY! Toxin has opened new doors to its potential. AND WE WILL USE THEM GRACIOUSLY!",
